With a stunning design using Reactjs, connected to the blockchain, metamask pairing, interaction with smart contracts, sending Ethereum through the blockchain network with solidity code, and much more.

Connected a regular react.js application to the blockchainand pair it to ethereum wallet using metamask with
writing smart contracts on the ethereum network using the solidity programming language.

# Process

---A full-fledged web application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain
each transaction will then be paired with a gif and it will be forever stored on the blockchain.

---A quick demo of the application 

     --built a modern fully responsive website once somebody joins the application they need to click connect wallet button this is immediately going to trigger a
       meta mask connection and it's going to ask us which account do we want to connect after connecting instantly you'll notice that the address of our account is            right here on this nice ethereum card and if we open up metamask you'll be able to see that our account is now connected.
     --Entire testing did on ropsten test network copy the address of our second account
       now paste that address at 'Adress To' the amount of ethereum we want to send at 'Amount(ETH)'. 
     --you can choose the 'keyword(Gif)' you want to attach to your specific transaction this keyword is going to be saved as data in the
       blockchain and you can also pass an additional piece of data at 'Enter message'.
     --let's click 'send now' metamask is going to ask us if we want to send so click confirm for all notifications.
     --Transaction is being sent as loading thens scroll down and see if transaction is here.
     --we have our latest transactions section here each transaction is stored in the blockchain forever we can see the address of the account that sent that ethereum          and not only that if you click it it's going to open up an ether scan and you'll be able to see that this is a real address that's sending real transactions              through the blockchain.
